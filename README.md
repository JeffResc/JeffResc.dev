# About
This is my website located at [jeffresc.dev](https://jeffresc.dev). It uses an automated Node.js script to automatically update itself. The website is based off of [gitfolio by imfunniee](https://github.com/imfunniee/gitfolio), as it was originally generated by that project, but I wanted to add some custom features that it did not support, so I decided to use it's great template with my own custom generator script.

# Editing
Use this [JeffResc/jeffresc.github.io-deploy](https://github.com/JeffResc/jeffresc.github.io-deploy) instead of directly editing this repository directly. All edits on [JeffResc/jeffresc.github.io-deploy](https://github.com/JeffResc/jeffresc.github.io-deploy) (on the master branch) will automatically be committed to this repository after a successful build by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/).
