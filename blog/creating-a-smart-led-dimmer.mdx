# Introduction
I frequently see [cheap battery-operated monochrome string lights](https://www.walmart.com/ip/859641125) on clearance at stores locally such as Walmart. I wanted to be able to take advantage of these deals, but most of the lighting equipment that I own is "smart" and tied into the [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) home automation system. I wanted to be able to bring these lights into my home automation system to control them more easily and tie them into my automations. There is the [QuinLED controller](https://quinled.info/), but it was a little overkill for these types of cheap monochrome string lights.

# Solution Proposal
I was looking for a device to satisfy the following requirements:
1. The device should be able to control at least one set of string lights (bonus points for multiple sets).
2. The device should be able to control the brightness of the lights.
3. The device should be able to control them via [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/).
4. Bonus points for extra headers for peripheral devices such as a [PIR Motion Sensor](https://esphome.io/cookbook/pir.html).
5. Bonus points for an onboard temperature sensor. They're cheap and can serve a variety of purposes for automations.

I created the following solution.

# Parts List
These are the parts I decided to go with for my build. It was purely based on availability and cost. I was not familiar with many of these brands (other than Sensirion) before using them, but I have not had any issues with my device.

Other than that, you will also need a [WeMos D1 MINI ESP32](https://docs.platformio.org/en/stable/boards/espressif32/wemos_d1_mini32.html) or [WeMos D1 ESP8266](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d1/d1_mini.html). The device is designed to work with either, but I have found it to work best with the ESP32 as it is more powerful and the [ESP32 LEDC Output](https://esphome.io/components/output/ledc.html) is a much better solution than the [ESP8266 Software PWM Output](https://esphome.io/components/output/esp8266_pwm.html).

# Digital Render
This is a digital render of the board using [MeshLab](https://www.meshlab.net/).

# Software
For the software to control the onboard ESP32 (or ESP8266), I decided to go with [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) due to its ease of use, especially with [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/). This is an example that I wrote which treats both LED outputs as one controller, that way two sets of lights can be controlled simultaneously. It can also read the value of the onboard [SHTC3](https://sensirion.com/media/documents/643F9C8E/6164081E/Sensirion_Humidity_Sensors_SHTC3_Datasheet.pdf) and report back to [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/).

# Final Results
I sent the final design files to [JLCPCB](https://www.jlcpcb.com/) for production. They are by far the cheapest PCB manufacturer to my knowledge, and I am satisfied with the build quality for these types of projects.

  It works great for controlling a variety of lights, with Wi-Fi and dimming support, it works great for my use case. If you have any questions about the design or software, feel free to reach out at [my name@jeffresc.dev and I'd be happy to help out.
